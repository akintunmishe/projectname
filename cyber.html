           <p> Cyber security definition.<br><br>
            Cyber security is the application of technologies, processes, and controls to protect systems, networks, programs, devices and data from cyber attacks.It aims to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect against the unauthorised exploitation of systems, networks, and technologies.<br>
            Why is cyber security important?<br>
            The costs of cyber security breaches are rising.
            Organisations that suffer cyber security breaches may face significant fines. There are also non-financial costs to be considered, like reputational damage.
            Cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated.
Cyber attacks continue to grow in sophistication, with attackers using an ever-expanding variety of tactics. These include social engineering, malware and ransomware.

           <p> Cyber security is a critical, board-level issue.
            New regulations and reporting requirements make cyber security risk oversight a challenge. The board needs assurance from management that its cyber risk strategies will reduce the risk of attacks and limit financial and operational impacts.<br> 
            Cyber crime is a big business.According to a study by McAfee and the CSIS, based on data collected by Vanson Bourne, the world economy loses more than $1 trillion each year due to cybercrime. Political, ethical, and social incentives can also drive attackers.<br>
            Who needs cyber security?<br>It is a mistake to believe that you are of no interest to cyber attackers. Everyone who is connected to the Internet needs cyber security. This is because most cyber attacks are automated and aim to exploit common vulnerabilities rather than specific websites or organisations.

            Cyber Security: Essential principles to secure your organisation – a pocket guide
            This pocket guide takes you through the fundamentals of cyber security, the principles that underpin it, vulnerabilities and threats, and how to defend your organisation againstfrom attacks.<br>
            Malware, such as ransomware, botnet software, RATs (remote access Trojans), rootkits and bootkits, spyware, Trojans, viruses, and worms.
            Backdoors, which allow remote access.<br>
            Formjacking, which inserts malicious code into online forms.
Cryptojacking, which installs illicit cryptocurrency mining software.
DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks, which flood servers, systems, and networks with traffic to knock them offline.
DNS (domain name system) poisoning attacks, which compromise the DNS to redirect traffic to malicious sites.
Learn more about the cyber threats you face, the vulnerabilities they exploit and the types of attacks that cyber criminals use to deliver them

                    <p> What are the five types of cyber security?<br>
                        1. Critical infrastructure cyber security
Critical infrastructure organisations are often more vulnerable to attack than others because SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems often rely on older software.<br>
2. Network security
Network security involves addressing vulnerabilities affecting your operating systems and network architecture, including servers and hosts, firewalls and wireless access points, and network protocols.<br>
3. Cloud security
Cloud security is concerned with securing data, applications, and infrastructure in the Cloud.<br>
4. IOT (Internet of Things) security
IOT security involves securing smart devices and networks connected to the IOT. IOT devices include things that connect to the Internet without human intervention, such as smart fire alarms, lights, thermostats, and other appliances.<br>
5. Application security
Application security involves addressing vulnerabilities resulting from insecure development processes in designing, coding, and publishing software or a websit.

       <p>  Cyber security vs information security.
        Cyber security is often confused with information security.<br>
        Cyber security focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorised access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible.
Information security is a broader category that protects all information assets, whether in hard copy or digital form.
The legal requirement for cyber security
The GDPR and DPA 2018 require organisations to implement appropriate security measures to protect personal data. Otherwise, you risk substantial fines.<br>
Cyber security is a critical business issue for every organisation.

Challenges of cyber security
Mitigating the cyber security risks facing your organisation can be challenging. This is especially true if you have moved to remote working and have less control over employees’ behaviour and device security.

        An effective approach must encompass your entire IT infrastructure and be based on regular risk assessments.

        Cyber attacks can cost organisations billions of pounds and cause severe damage. Impacted organisations stand to lose sensitive data and face fines and reputational damage.

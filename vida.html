<p> Video analytics is a technology that processes a digital video signal using a special algorithm to perform a security-related function. There are three common types of video analytics:<br>
    •
Fixed algorithm analytics<br>

•
Artificial intelligence learning algorithms<br>

•
Facial recognition systems<br>The first two of these try to achieve the same result. That is, they try to determine if an unwanted or suspicious behavior is occurring in the field of view of a video camera and the algorithm notifies the console operator of the finding. However, each takes a dramatically different route to get to its result. Fixed algorithm analytics use an algorithm that is designed to perform a specific task and look for a specific behavior. For example, common behaviors that fixed algorithm analytics look for including the following:<br><br>
•
Crossing a line<br>

•
Moving in the wrong direction down a corridor<br>

•
Leaving an article<br>

•
Picking up an article<br>

•
Loitering<br>

•
Floating face down in a swimming pool<br>

            <div class="design-text">
           <p> An example illustrates the usefulness of this approach. In one early installation at a major international airport that was intended to spot children climbing on a baggage carousel, the system alerted on a man who picked up a small bag from the carousel and placed it inside an empty larger bag. The man was intercepted and interrogated only to discover that the luggage inside his did not belong to him and that he was part of a ring who came to the airport regularly to steal baggage in this way. The airport had no idea this was even occurring, so there was no way they could have purchased a fixed behavior algorithm for this, even if such existed (which it did not). This approach to video analytics is most useful.

            The third type of analytic is facial recognition. <br>Facial recognition systems can be used for access control or to help identify friend or foe. Facial recognition systems can also be used to further an investigation.
            
            Typical facial recognition systems match points on a face with a sample stored in a database. If the face does not match a record, it will try to create a new record from the best image of that person available. These are capable of making real-time matches of one image against many. The latest version of facial recognition systems constructs 3-D maps of faces in real time and compares those to a truly vast database. One manufacturer claims to be able to match individuals in real time against a country-sized database of images (millions of records).
            
            Traditional facial recognition systems require well-lit scenes and fairly static backgrounds. <br>The latest versions are reported to work under fair to poor lighting and with dynamic backgrounds.

            Video analytics process video in real-time and transform it into intelligent data. They automatically generate descriptions of what is happening in the video (metadata) and are used to detect and track objects which also could be categorized as persons, vehicles, and other objects in the video stream. This information forms the basis on which to perform actions, e.g. to decide if security staff should be notified or if a higher quality recording stream should be used. Video analytics turn simple IP video into business intelligence.<br><br>
            Video analytics is a much more practical solution to reviewing hours of surveillance video to identify incidents that are pertinent to what you are looking for. Utilizing video analytics will increase the efficiency of your security monitoring process and decrease the workload on security and management staff.<br>
            When used in conjunction with a video management system (VMS), you can act upon the metadata generated by video analytics. Surveillance automation allows you to create rules to alert security personnel for specific events of interest.

                    <p>How Video Analytics Software Works<br><br>
Video Analytics uses advanced algorithms and machine learning to monitor, analyze and manage large volumes of video. They digitally analyze video inputs, transforming them into intelligent data, which helps in decision-making.<br>
Video analytics software (CCTV software)  can come pre-installed on your closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras, on a network video recorder (NVR), or as a built-in or third-party plugin to the video management software (VMS). An open VMS platform like Senstar Symphony enables you to choose the optimal hardware for your security surveillance infrastructure.<br><br>
Video Analytics augments traditional security video surveillance infrastructure with new detection capabilities that include:<br>
License Plate Recognition (ALPR) <br>
Facial Recognition<br>
Crowd Detection<br>
Indoor People Tracking<br>
Left and Removed Item Detection<br>
Motion Tracking<br>
Object Tracking<br>
Outdoor People and Vehicle Tracking<br>
People Counting<br>
PTZ Auto-Tracking<br>
Motion Detection<br>
Heat mapping <br>
Intrusion detection<br>

               <p> What is artificial intelligence (AI)?
    
    
                
                Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.<br>
                The concept of inanimate objects endowed with intelligence has been around since ancient times. The Greek god Hephaestus was depicted in myths as forging robot-like servants out of gold. Engineers in ancient Egypt built statues of gods animated by priests. Throughout the centuries, thinkers from Aristotle to the 13th century Spanish theologian Ramon Llull to Ren√© Descartes and Thomas Bayes used the tools and logic of their times to describe human thought processes as symbols, laying the foundation for AI concepts such as general knowledge representation.

               <p> How does AI work?
                As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.
                
                In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.
                
                AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.
                
                Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task.

                4 main types of artificial intelligence: Explained
                7 key benefits of AI for business
                10 steps to achieve AI implementation in your business<br><br>
                Why is artificial intelligence important?<br><br>
                AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.
                
                This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest companies in the world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on the road before they're needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online services by using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. In 2017, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an "AI first" company.
                
                Today's largest and most successful enterprises have used AI to improve their operations and gain advantage on their competitors.

                   <p> What are the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence?<br><br>
                    Artificial neural networks and deep learning artificial intelligence technologies are quickly evolving, primarily because AI processes large amounts of data much faster and makes predictions more accurately than humanly possible.<br><br>
                    
                    Advantages<br><br>
    
                    Good at detail-oriented jobs;
                    Reduced time for data-heavy tasks;
                    Delivers consistent results; and
                    AI-powered virtual agents are always available.<br><br>
                    
                    Disadvantages<br><br>
    
    Expensive;
    Requires deep technical expertise;
    Limited supply of qualified workers to build AI tools;
    Only knows what it's been shown; and
    Lack of ability to generalize from one task to another.
    Strong AI vs. weak AI.

           <p> AI is incorporated into a variety of different types of technology. Here are six examples:
    
            Automation. When paired with AI technologies, automation tools can expand the volume and types of tasks performed. An example is robotic process automation (RPA), a type of software that automates repetitive, rules-based data processing tasks traditionally done by humans. When combined with machine learning and emerging AI tools, RPA can automate bigger portions of enterprise jobs, enabling RPA's tactical bots to pass along intelligence from AI and respond to process changes.
            Machine learning. This is the science of getting a computer to act without programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that, in very simple terms, can be thought of as the automation of predictive analytics. There are three types of machine learning algorithms:
            Supervised learning. Data sets are labeled so that patterns can be detected and used to label new data sets.
            Unsupervised learning. Data sets aren't labeled and are sorted according to similarities or differences.
            Reinforcement learning. Data sets aren't labeled but, after performing an action or several actions, the AI system is given feedback.
